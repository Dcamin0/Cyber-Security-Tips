### Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**Two-factor authentication (2FA)** is an extra layer of protection that helps keep your accounts safe. Instead of just using your password, 2FA requires you to confirm your identity using a second method, like a code sent to your phone.

Here’s how 2FA works:
1. **Enter your password**: When you log in, you use your usual password.
2. **Enter a code**: You’ll then receive a code on your phone (through SMS or an authentication app), which you enter to finish logging in.

**Why 2FA is important**: Even if someone steals your password, they won’t be able to access your account without the second factor (the code). This makes it much harder for hackers to get in.

**How to set it up**: Go to your account settings (like Google or Facebook) and look for "Two-Factor Authentication" in the security section. Follow the instructions to link your phone.
