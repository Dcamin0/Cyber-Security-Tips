### Recognizing Phishing Scams

Phishing is when scammers trick you into giving them your personal information, like your login details or credit card numbers. They often do this through fake emails, websites, or messages that look like they’re from legitimate companies or people you know.

Here’s how to recognize phishing attempts:

- **Check the sender’s email**: If the email is from a strange or unfamiliar address, be suspicious.
- **Look for typos**: Legitimate companies usually don’t make spelling or grammar mistakes in their emails.
- **Don’t click on links**: If an email asks you to click a link or download an attachment, it might be a phishing attempt. Always hover over the link to see the real URL.
- **Verify requests**: If you get an email asking for personal information, verify it with the company or person directly using their official contact information.
