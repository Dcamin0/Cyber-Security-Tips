### The Importance of Software Updates

Software updates are important because they fix security holes that hackers could exploit. When your phone, computer, or apps ask for updates, don’t ignore them!

Here’s why updates matter:
- **Patch vulnerabilities**: Hackers can take advantage of weaknesses in outdated software to steal your information.
- **Add new features**: Updates not only fix bugs but also often include new features to improve security.
- **Prevent malware**: Some updates specifically protect against the latest viruses or malware.

**Tip**: Set your devices to update automatically, so you don’t have to worry about missing important patches.
