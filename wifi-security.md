### Securing Your Wi-Fi Network

A **Wi-Fi network** that isn’t secure can allow hackers to access your devices and steal your personal data. Here’s how to protect your home network:

- **Change the default password**: Many routers come with a default username and password. Change it to something unique and strong.
- **Enable WPA3 encryption**: This is the most secure encryption method for Wi-Fi. Make sure your router uses WPA3 (or at least WPA2).
- **Turn off remote management**: If you don’t need to access your router settings from outside your home, disable this feature to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Use a guest network**: If you have visitors who need Wi-Fi, set up a separate guest network to keep your main network secure.
