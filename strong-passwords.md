### Creating Strong Passwords

A **password** is the most basic way to secure your accounts, but many people use weak or easy-to-guess passwords. A weak password is something like "123456" or "password," which hackers can guess in seconds. Here's how to create a strong password:

- **Use a mix of characters**: Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols (!, @, #, $, etc.).
- **Make it long**: Aim for at least 12 characters. The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.
- **Avoid personal information**: Don’t use names, birthdates, or anything related to you that someone could easily guess.
- **Use a password manager**: Password managers are tools that help you store and organize your passwords securely, so you don’t have to remember all of them.

**Example of a strong password**: `X9@dWz5!q7e#T3oP`
